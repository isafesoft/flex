        Google Company Culture
        Google is a high-energy, fast-paced work environment. While the dress code might be “casual” the company attracts and retains some of the brightest minds in the technology industry. There is a work hard, play hard atmosphere. The Google Mountain View, CA headquarters (aka “the Googleplex”) is a campus-like environment. There are workout facilities, a café, well-stocked snack rooms, and a dorm like environment. View the Google Office Descriptions for more details.

        In my opinion, one of the coolest programs at Google is the 20% time program. All Engineers at Google are encouraged to spend 20% of their work time on projects that interest them. Not only does this keep Engineers happy and challenged, but its also good business: some estimates put half of all new product launches can be directly attributed to projects that came from the 20% time program.
